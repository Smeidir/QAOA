Questions for today:


- differing p levels


Next time:
- Finish warm start- cplex or ipopt
- Recursive hopefully
- Look at parameter initializers on page 22 - What do i want to do?
- Check ut goemanns-williamson algorithm  - parameter estimation with this?
- QUBO 2 ising, (for the quantum) and ibm quadratic program with restrictions for cplexÂ¨
- Feel for classical vs quantum -> run classic optimizer and scale WITH CONSTRAINTS
-> Dont do random graphs, do specific graphs (see the genetic algorithm paper) //or other
- use the timing of cplex solver
- fully connectedness and connectedness of graphs- for report
