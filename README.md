Next time:

- finalize everything for max cut to "save" 
- Is it feasible to run ideal circuits on IBM but not train on it?
- Do operators commute`? commute?
- Find mixer operators which preserve hard constraints
- Solve for circuits locally and run on cloud?



Next time:

- Look at parameter initializers on page 22 - What do i want to do?
- Check ut goemanns-williamson algorithm  - parameter estimation with this?
- Feel for classical vs quantum -> run classic optimizer and scale WITH CONSTRAINTS
-> Dont do random graphs, do specific graphs (see the genetic algorithm paper) //or other
- fully connectedness and connectedness of graphs- for report
- finalize everything for max cut to "save"

- Combine warm-start and recursive
- Compare the two
- Examine the state of quantum computing for the max cut problem in realtion to IBM's connectivity map?
- Reduce the problem size so that i can see it converges on IBM
- Print intermediate results
- For example: reduce until i can get results and discuss why, springbrett into how the connectivity works
- Summer school
- Check fully connected graph
- Check fully connected graph for k-cut - when does it stop being able to run on IBM?
- Explaining connectivity constraints
- Is there a function that can tell me whether or not the graph can represent a given problem?

for report:

bACKGROUND: Familiarize reader about the topic - why am i doing all this??

Ideally, text size of the plots should be the same size as the text.

todo:
If cobyla works by using the quantum circuit as an oracle, what is the criteria for the oracle to outperform an ordinary computer?

Q for finley:
- Is offset important when you trasnlate from qubo?
- What is iterative p-thing?
