Questions for today:


- differing p levels


Next time:
- Recursive hopefully
- Look at parameter initializers on page 22 - What do i want to do?
- Check ut goemanns-williamson algorithm  - parameter estimation with this?
- QUBO 2 ising, (for the quantum) and ibm quadratic program with restrictions for cplexÂ¨
- Feel for classical vs quantum -> run classic optimizer and scale WITH CONSTRAINTS
-> Dont do random graphs, do specific graphs (see the genetic algorithm paper) //or other
- fully connectedness and connectedness of graphs- for report

- finalize everything for max cut to "save" 
- Is it feasible to run ideal circuits on IBM but not train on it?
- ensure eigensolver uses qaoa
- Do operators commute`? commute?
- Find mixer operators which preserve hard constraints
- Solve for circuits locally and run on cloud?
- Is offset important when you trasnlate from qubo?
